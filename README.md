## Project Title: Healthcare Data Analysis and Insights
### Problem Statement:
The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data daily, providing valuable insights for
healthcare providers and policymakers to improve patient care, allocate resources effectively,
and manage healthcare costs. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive healthcare dataset
comprising medical examinations, hospitalization details, and customer profiles to extract
insights into patient health profiles, medical histories, and healthcare costs. By exploring
relationships between various health metrics, identifying trends, and visualizing key patterns,
we aim to deliver actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders for informed decision-making
through rigorous data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and analysis.
## Project Steps and Objectives:
### Data Cleaning:
1. Check for the number of missing values marked with '?' in each column of the “Medical
Examinations” Table and "Hospitalization Details" Table.
2. Fill in the missing values of ‘month’ with Sep and ‘year’ with its average rounded to the
nearest integer.
3. Determine the most frequently occurring values in the ‘smoker’, 'Hospital tier' and 'City tier'
columns, and fill in the missing values accordingly.
4. If any 'State ID' values are missing, consider filling them with 'Unknown' or using another
appropriate strategy.
### Data Transformation:
1. Split the ‘names’ column in the “Customer Names” Table into 3 meaningful columns: ‘Title’,
‘First Name’, and ‘Last Name’.
2. Convert the "NumberOfMajorSurgeries" column in the “Medical Examinations” Table to
numerical data by replacing non-numeric characters with meaningful numerical values.
3. Check for inconsistencies in the 'Heart Issues' and 'smoker' columns and propose corrective
actions if necessary.
4. Create a new column named “Weight Status” that categorizes BMI into different categories
as below:

5. Create a new column named “Diabetes Status” and fill it as per the information given below:

6. Merge ‘year’, ‘month’ and ‘date’ columns in the “Hospitalization Details” Table into one
column named ‘Date of Birth’ and format it in ‘DD-MMM-YYYY’ custom format.
7. Calculate the ‘Age’ of each customer based on their ‘Date of Birth’ and the date of
collection of the dataset, which is 8 th June 2023.
8. Format ‘charges’ column as currency ($).
### Data Exploration:
#### ➔ Customer Names Table:
1. Are there any duplicate Customer IDs in the dataset? If yes, how many?
2. How many customers are included in the dataset?<br>

#### ➔ Medical Examination Table:
1. How many customers have a history of cancer?
2. Identify the customer(s) with the highest BMI.
3. How many customers have Diabetes?
4. How many obese customers have heart issues?
5. What is the total number of major surgeries performed on customers?
6. Calculate the percentage of customers who have undergone any transplants.
7. Find the average HBA1C value of customers who are smokers.
8. How many customers with heart issues have done transplant?
9. What is the average BMI of the customers who have done more than 2 major surgeries?<br>

#### ➔ Hospitalization details Table:
1. Calculate all the Summary statistics for the ‘charges’ column.
2. Which is the median age and the most common age in the dataset?
3. Find the average hospitalization charges for customers who are more than 50 years old.
4. Compare the total charges across different hospital tiers.
5. Which city tier has the highest average hospitalization charges?
6. Calculate the average charges for people who have more than 2 children.
7. Find the integer average number of children of customers who are less than 40 years old.<br>

### Data Analysis:
➢ Create a new sheet named “Healthcare, combine all three tables into one, using
Customer ID as the common column, utilizing VLOOKUP.<br>
➢ Retain the following necessary columns: Customer ID, First Name, BMI, HBA1C, Heart
Issues, Any Transplants, Cancer history, NumberOfMajorSurgeries, smoker, Weight
Status, Diabetes Status, Date of Birth, charges, Hospital tier, City tier, State ID, Age.<br><br>
![Screenshot (148)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64f0465-6cf8-4fac-89df-d5446131a765)<br>
★ Create pivot tables if required to do the following analysis, then visualize through charts:
#### Analysis using Pie/Donut Chart:
1. What is the distribution of cancer history among smokers and non-smokers?
2. How does the total number of major surgeries and average HbA1C differ between
patients with and without a history of transplants?<br>
![Screenshot (150)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e859bffe-6172-4fc3-bf57-e9c2105ae1f4)

#### Analysis using Column/Bar Chart:
3. How do healthcare charges vary based on different weight statuses and diabetes
statuses?
4. Can you compare the average charges for each hospital tier within different states?<br>

#### Analysis using Line/Scatter Plot:
5. Is there any correlation between age and both BMI and HbA1C in the dataset?
6. Explore the relationship between age and healthcare charges.<br>
