This project aims to analyze a comprehensive healthcare dataset comprising medical examinations, hospitalization details, and customer profiles to extract insights into patient health profiles, medical histories, and healthcare costs.
By exploring relationships between various health metrics, identifying trends, and visualizing key patterns, I aim to deliver actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders for informed decision-making through rigorous data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and analysis.

STEP-by-STEP Progress:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) [Data souring]
 Looking over the data and understanding it.
 Dataset overview:
 - 3 sheets, with total 17 features
 - 2,335 records
 |
 |
(2) [Data Cleaning]
 - Dealing with inconsistency.
 - Handling missing values and outliers.
 |
 |
(3) [Data Transformation]
 - Creating new columns that simplifies other columns. (Ex. Weight Status, Diabetes Status)
 - Splitting columns. (Ex. From full name to Title, First, Last)
 |
 |
(4) [Data Exploration] 
 Exploration on each tables, which includes
 - Customer Names table
 - Medical Examination table
 - Hospitalization Details table
 |
 |
(5) [Data Merging] 
 Merging 3 tables into one using vlookup and CustomerId as common column
 |
 |
(6) [Data Analysis] 
 Analysis done by Data Visualisation which includes
 - Pie/Donut Chart
 - Column/Bar Chart
 - Line/Scatter Plot
